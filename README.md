# Exploring-Trends-In-American-Baby-Names

## Overview
This project analyzes historical trends in baby names in the United States between 1920 and 2020 using PostgreSQL.  
The goal is to uncover long-term naming patterns, identify names that have remained popular over time, and highlight how social and cultural changes influence naming preferences.

The analysis was performed entirely in PostgreSQL, with queries executed through Jupyter Notebook using the `ipython-sql` extension.
